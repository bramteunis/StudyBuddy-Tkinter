### **Project Description:**  
**StudyBuddy-Tkinter** is a simple desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library that helps students manage their schedules and plan their homework efficiently. The app allows users to check their daily class schedules, add homework tasks, and organize their study routine in an easy-to-use interface.

Fun fact: This is the very first project I ever coded when I was around **10 years old**! It's where I took my first steps into the world of programming, combining my curiosity for tech with a practical tool to help with schoolwork. ðŸŽ“âœ¨
